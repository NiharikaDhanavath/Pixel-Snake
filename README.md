# Pixel-Snake

I developed the classic snake game using Python's Pygame library. To take things up a notch, I have turned a game into a website. 
Here's the link: 

But if you want to play the game on the pygame window on your device, please follow the following instructions:
1. Open bash, and enter, "pip install pygame"
2. Downlload the file on my repository named, "snake_game.py."
3. Open bash again and enter, "python snake_game.py"

# Play-the-game
1. A new window will open displaying the Snake game.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
   Up Arrow to move up
   Down Arrow to move down
   Left Arrow to move left
   Right Arrow to move right
3. The snake will grow in length when it eats the red "snack."
